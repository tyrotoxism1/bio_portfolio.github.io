		<h1>Genes, Behavior & Evolution Portfolio</h1>
		<h1>Cover page</h1>
		<h2 id="name">By Micah Janzen</h2>
		<h2>Portfolio Format:</h2>
		<p>The format for this portfolio is a little website. Below there are buttons for each of the different 
			outcomes describe in the requirments, clicking on the buttons will bring you to the specific outcome and 
			show the example of mastery for that outcome, from a paragraph that may describe how somehting works, to
			a picture that shows the structure of some organism. (note that the current look of the website is not final
			but the structre will be as described.)
		</p>
		<h2>How the Portfolio Demonstrates Mastery:</h2>
		<p>
			Each outcome will show some kind of mastery of the topic or idea. With each outcome, there has been a specific
			answer or a specific explanation or showing of how the topic. With each of the showins of mastery, typically they may 
			have been graded well, showing that some definition or explanation of an idea is correct. And each of these outcomes and their
			respective media shown, come from a growing of experince from the term. As the term went on I collected more media as well as 
			more knowledge of these outcomes.
		</p>
		<h2>How this Portfolio can be use in the Future:</h2>
		<p>
			This portfolio will essentially act as time capsule for me to look back on, but more than that, it can be used as a reference,
			and even better can be added to. Since this is a website that is digitally avalaible, it can always be added to as more knowledge is accrued
			over time. This portfolio is helpful more more than bio, but also how to learn and document the process of learning which will always be helpful
			in my career in college and even in a profession.
