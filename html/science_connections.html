        <p>
            The science connection outcome is aimed to connect and relate science to other topics and ideas. This includes 
            things like news, global issues, art, institutions, jobs, etc. Mastery of science connection can be shown 
            media such as news story summary, drawings, and data visualization. 
        </p>
    
        <h2>Mastery #1:</h2>
        <p>
            In the first media piece for science connection, I have included a data visualization. The data was for physics 212 where 
            my group and I looked at the motion of a swinging pendulum in a real environment with friction and other forces. This media piece
            demonstrates science connection because it connects the theory of science to the real world. Also for this visualization, there was a lab 
            with other peers or other future scientists which built experience with working with others on a study or lab.

        <h2>Mastery #2:</h2>
        <p>
            For the second media piece, I've included a news summary I did for my GEO GEO 308 class. 
            This news summary, summarizes a study done on global warming and it's effects on animals. 
            This summary shows mastery for the science connections outcome since it serves to inform myself and others
            about global issues beyond just science. This media piece also shows mastery in the relation of science and global change/effects.

                Publication Date: November 23, 2020<br>
                Name of Media: <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201123161032.htm">Science Daily</a><br>
            Title: Global warming likely to increase disease risk for animals worldwide <br>
        Summary: <br>
	        A study conducted by University of Notre Dame, University of South florida and University of Wisconsin-Madison 
            found supporting evidence for a phenomenon known as “thermal mismatch hypothesis”. The article explains how this hypothesis describes
            how the greatest risk for infectious disease is when the climate of a cold-adapted animal becomes warm, or when a warm-adapted
            animal’s environment becomes colder. The article references a quote from a professor of Notre Dame, pointing out how important this
            research is considering the current pandemic the world is seeing. The article continues to talk about how the data was collected and how the
            researchers correlated the data to a conclusion. The researchers found that the data they collected strengthened the hypothesis previously mentioned, and that when 
            coupled with models of global climate change projections, they were able to predict where the risk of animal infectious disease might change 
            the most. The article sums up by stating how global warming will likely shift infectious disease away from the equator, but will see an increase
            in the highland tropics, where the temperate and cooler regions of the planet are.
