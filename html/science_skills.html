          The science skills outcome is meant to broaden one's experience and understanding of
           science with discovery and exploration of the real world. Mastery for this outcome can be
            demonstrated with examples of exploration & discovery, reasoning & analysis, and/or science study with analysis.

        <h2>Mastery #1:</h2>
        <p>
            Below is media piece 5B where I conducted a small experiment to simulate predator-prey model. This media piece 
            demonstrates mastery by showing science study skill, as well as reasoning. In the conducted study I used reasoning to determine
            which structure is better for a specific prey.

        <div class="column">
           <p style="font-size: large;"; id="text_paragraph">
            "For my simulation I used nuts. So for the prey variation, I had hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds,
            peanuts and finally pecans. For the predators I used different utensils. The predators were the
            spoon, the chopstick, the bag clip, the scissors and fork. For the prey the variation was in the
            shapes and sizes, the different sized nuts changed how they had to be grabbed. The hazelnuts
            were round so difficult with the chopsticks and scissors, but were easy for the spoon and bag
            clip. The more flat ones like the pecans were relatively easy to prey upon for the chopsticks and
            scissors. For the variation of the prey, there were more sharp and precise prey such as the
            chopsticks and the scissors, these allowed for either cutting or quick pick up with the right prey.
            But the bag clip, spoon and fork had an easier time with the more rounded prey where they
            could just scoop them up."<br>
            "To better this simulation I would’ve liked to get more drastic variation in both the prey and the
            predators. I would’ve liked it so some of the predators would actually not have been able to pick
            up or attack some of the prey. This would have made more of a realistic situation in that
            sometimes the feeding mechanism can really affect the prey that they thrive on.  "

        <h2 style="padding-top: 50px;">Mastery #2:</h2>
        <p>
            In the second media piece, I've used a quiz answer to show mastery of science skills. The quiz question asked to describe 3 factors that would reduce the 
            carrying capacity for fish. My answer shows mastery of the science skills outcome because it applies knowledge learned from science concepts to interpret and analyze data/specific details 
            about animals. 

        <div class="column">
            <h4>Quiz Question:</h4>
            <p id="text_paragraph">
                You are managing fish in a lake and notice there are fewer fish each year.  Describe three factors that may be reducing carrying capacity for the fish, including a description of what carrying capacity is.            
            </p>
            <h4>My answer:</h4>
            <p style="font-size: large;"; id="text_paragraph">
                When looking at the carrying capacity of an environment or habitat, there are many, many options/factors that could be effecting the animals/organisms living in the habitat. 
                These factors all play a role in determine the carrying capacity, which is the analyzed value or limit to a certain species' population, so at a certain point
                a population will stop growing or begin to die off. In the case of managing fish in the lake, one big factor could be overpopulation, which then would lead to less 
                food for each individual fish. Another factor that comes with the carrying capacity, is the lack of oxygen, since the producers of the oxygen only produce so much 
                and the lake will only hold so much, if the fish are taking in too much oxygen, it could cause fish to not have enough oxygen and die. A final potential factor 
                could be a lack of space. Similar to the lack of oxygen, when there are too many fish in the lake, this can cause problems with the fish potentially be territorial, 
                or unable to reproduce when near other fish. The can lead to death with competition in the case of territorial fish, or less reproducing if fish are unable to 
                reproduce with the lack of space. Both would lead to a decline in population, and could reduce the carrying capacity for the fish.
