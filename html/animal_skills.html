        <h2>Mastery #1: Field kit</h2>
        <p>
            The first media is a field kit, which demonstrates mastery of animal skills since 
            it shows I'm prepared for studying animals in the outdoors safely. Mastery of animal skill is
            also demonstrated from working with my dog.

        <figcaption>In the First picture, the items included are: Rain coat, map,
             knife, camera, flashlight, 3' measuring tape, pencil and small notebook,
              tent(the tent is really deep in storage atm), and a backpack to hold all of
               these items. I would also bring my dog, who is great at finding her way back
                and keeping people together on hikes!
