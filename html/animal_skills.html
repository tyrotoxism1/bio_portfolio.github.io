            Animal Skills relates to the study and handling of animals. Mastery of this outcome is shown with media, objects and characteristics such as safety kits,
            field kits, animal observation, handling of animals, maintaining wildlife,animals and habitats along with many more examples. Provided below are examples that 
            were created or shown throughout the course of Bio 102.

        <h2>Mastery #1: Field kit</h2>
        <p>
            The first media is a field kit, which demonstrates mastery of animal skills since 
            it shows I'm prepared for studying animals in the outdoors safely. Mastery of animal skill is
            also demonstrated from working with my dog.

        <figcaption>In the First picture, the items included are: Rain coat, map,
             knife, camera, flashlight, 3' measuring tape, pencil and small notebook,
              tent(the tent is really deep in storage atm), and a backpack to hold all of
               these items. I would also bring my dog, who is great at finding her way back
                and keeping people together on hikes!

           <h3>Animal Care Plan:</h3>
           <li>For my animal, while simple and typical, I will choose a dog </li>
           <li>How you will address potentially limited resources like food, water, and housing.</li>
           <p style="font-size: large;"; >
            For that, it is mostly a matter of money and housing. I will make sure that I have
            the funds to purchase food that is good for the dog, as well as be able to provide
            water. For housing, I’m currently living with my parents as of the time during the
            pandemic, but when I move back out to campus during the fall term, I have a
            house lined up where my roommates already have one dog, this will take care of
            shelter and provide a companion for the dog.
           </p>
           <li>How you will address continued threats like diseases or potential predators (if any)</li>
           <p style="font-size: large;"; >
            For diseases, I will sort of cluster ticks into this category since that can often be
            an issue for dogs. For ticks there is a repellent that can be applied to the dog’s
            necks, this helps with preventing ticks. For predators, I have a fenced off
            backyard and when I let the dog out, I would accompany the dog and play with it.
            Other than the outdoors, the dog will mostly remain inside where it is safe from
            any predators such as coyotes and similar predators
           </p>
           <li>Whether care will need to be adjusted for different life stages, for example, an aging animal.</li>
           <p style="font-size: large;"; >
                In the earlier stages of the dog's life, we will want to spend a lot of time
                with it, training it and creating good habits. I will also want to provide a lot
                of toys that can allow the dog to teeth. Along with these things, it needs to
                be watched for going to the bathroom as the dog may not know where is
                correct or okay for it to go to the bathroom. As time goes on these things
                can lax a bit, the toys can be less common, the training less strict, and the
                watchful eye can be less intense
            </p>
            <li>How you will stay consistent with care over time as your life changes.</li>
            <p style="font-size: large;"; >
                    To make sure that the right amount of attention is provided for the dog,
                    and big decisions will be made with the thought of the dog having trouble
                    maybe adapting or being able to survive comfortably in a new
                    environment. These changes could be moving away, change in schedule
                    or unexpected event that requires my attention. For moving, moving with
                    the dog shouldn't be too bad as long as wherever we go, there is food,
                    water and shelter that the dog can have. For the changes in schedule, I
                    will be living with roommates for a long time, so if need be they can baby
                    sit my dog, and since I already live with them it won’t be a strange
                    environment for the dog, it’ll essentially be the same. For the unexpected
                    event that requires my attention, the same thing can be done as with the
                    change in schedule where the roommates can take care of the dog for me
                    for a bit. I would make sure that before I settle with the dog in the house
                    that I talk it over with them about having potentially some responsibility
                    with the dog, but I’m sure that this would be fine since we already have a
                    dog.
