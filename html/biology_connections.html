        <p>
           The biology connections outcome takes what was learnt from concepts and skills and applies them to everyday
           life. Mastery of this outcome is shown with plans for the future, which can mean goals, use of techniques, trips, day to day science and so on.

        <h2>Mastery #1:</h2>
        <p>
            The image provided below shows the process of protein synthesis. This drawing demonstrates a mastery of biology connections since it happens every moment of the day.
            While it isn't visible, this media piece is an important component of understanding and connecting a big part of biology together.
        </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 50px;">Mastery #2:</h2>
        <p>
          For the second media piece, I have included my science bucket list. This shows a mastery of biology connection because it takes the things I've learned in this class
          to a broader scope. While not all goals are focused on biology, they are each creating a connection to making connections with people, strengthening and growing my knowledge and shows a plan for the future
        </p>
        <div class="column" id="text_paragraph">
            <h4>Science Bucket List:</h4>

            <li><b>Goal 1:</b> I want to create a website that provides derivations and interactive elements for math. </li>
            <p >
                After taking quite a few math courses for my major, I have really begun to enjoy it. Though while taking the course not
                so much due to stress. But I really enjoyed classes like Vector calculus 2, where we learn about these interesting 2d and 3d 
                interactions between vectors and their properties. So I would like to make a website to not only teach others, but more so to 
                strengthen my knowledge of the topics.
            </p>

            <li><b>Goal 2:</b> Each day I want to learn about one biology related fact. </li>
            <p >
                This can be something small or a general topic but I’ve really enjoyed learning about all this interesting different species and organisms. 
                I always avoided biology classes in high school(I actually never took one, this is my first) but this class has been really interesting and enjoyable. 
                So I’d like to continue the idea of this class and try to learn something new everyday even if it’s something small like how the dance fly males will 
                bring food items wrapped in silk or webs. But I hope to also go more in depth, like how these dance flies don’t create their own silk, and the fact 
                that there are times where the male will bring an silk cocoon, present it to the female, mate, and then when the female goes to eat the food item, 
                it’s empty. And the fact that the females adapted to this happening and sometimes watch the male kill the prey or get the food that is to be wrapped.
            </p>

            <li><b>Goal 3:</b> I want to build an off-grid solar system for a house</li>
            <p >
                This one is a bit on the smaller scope, but I think it’s very important to learn and grow. This would force me to test things, learn and fully understand the idea of electricity
            </p>
               
            <li><b>Goal 4:</b> I want to help in the prevention of animal or species extinction.</li>
            <p >
                After learning about how impactful the extinction of a species and even more so the recovery of the at species, I felt that I should take more 
                initiative to helping. This is a relatively broad goal, but would include small things like donating to charities or non-profit organizations that 
                help with recovery programs. This goal could also include more grand things like working for the non-profit organizations in helping recover species, 
                track and analyze patterns that may help us understand what is happening and so on. 
            </p>

            <li><b>Goal 5:</b> I want to graduate college with a 3.5 GPA or higher. </li>
            <p >
                This one is very basic and short sighted, but it is important to me and potentially my future in getting a career. I didn’t start my college career on the 
                strongest foot so I am currently facing a bit of an uphill battle but it is possible with the right steps and process.
