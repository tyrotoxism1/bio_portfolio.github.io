        <p>
            Science concepts focuses on the ideas and theory behind how something works or interacts. 
            It allows for a through description of themes and characteristics for science. Ways to demonstrate 
            mastery of science concepts is through facts, evidence, prediction, studies, system and models, hypothesis,
            history along with other forms of information that can show concepts of science in a clear way.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Mastery #1:</h2>
        <p>
            The media piece below is an example mastery of science concepts since it shows interpretation, hypothesis
            and analysis of the pattern shown in nature.

            Tree bark has a interesting pattern different from many other plants, trees have bark with cracks
            that create interesting patterns. Bark in general serves to protect the inner tree form heat, cold,
            physical forces and other damaging forces, it acts like armor for the tree. But the bark isnâ€™t just a
            flat piece of armor, it has cracks and crevices. This may be because it allows for the tree to
            breath and obtain/disperse nutrients from things such as water or air. These cracks allow for
            more of a flow from one part of the tree to another and creates very small tunnel ways for air, water, and other things
            to circulate.

        <h2 style="padding-top: 50px;">Mastery #2:</h2>
        <p>
            In the second media piece, I've used a quiz answer to show mastery of science concepts. The quiz question asks about 2 different ways a species can mutate. The quiz answer shows mastery 
            of the outcome because it provides an example to break down how the 2 different concepts of mutation can occur within a species.

            <h4>Quiz Question:</h4>
            <p id="text_paragraph">
                Describe two scenarios: one in which a new species forms by allopatric speciation, and one in which a species forms through sympatric speciation.
            </p>
            <h4>My answer:</h4>
            <p style="font-size: large;"; id="text_paragraph">
                Let's say there were a species of trees. In the first scenario, the trees are split apart due to an earthquake that splits the land in two, with some kind of 
                ravine in the middle. Over time, this species would mutate, but they would each mutate differently depending on these new locations. Maybe one of areas of trees
                receives more light while the other receives less now. This would eventually most likely cause differing mutation between the two. In the second scenario, maybe
                humans planted a different kind of species of tree in the same area as this hypothetical tree species. Over time there may be some of the original trees that are 
                able to breed with the new species of trees creating a new kind of tree that may not be able to breed with the original species of tree.
