        <p>
            Biology skills is all about applying knowledge gained from studying to researching and 
            gaining more information from organisms and the environment. Mastery of this outcome is shown
            from observation, research, data collection, to creative thinking and visualization of data.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Mastery #1:</h2>
        <p>
             The first media piece that shows mastery of biology skills is, research notes I did while
             taking field notes. The field notes show mastery because they show application of note taking
             in the outdoors. The media piece shows observation, visualization and interpretation of both the 
             environment and notes.

        <p>
            In the second media piece, I've used a quiz answer to show mastery of biology skills. The quiz question asked to describe some of the things humans are able to do 
            with the use of a large cerebral cortex. This shows mastery of biology skills since
            the answer required research, and application of the newfound knowledge in the form of a structured answer.

        <div class="column">
            <h4>Quiz Question:</h4>
            <p id="text_paragraph">
                Humans have a large cerebral cortex.  From the video, describe three things our large cerebral cortex enables us to do. 
            </p>
            <h4>My answer:</h4>
            <p style="font-size: large;"; id="text_paragraph">
                Humans have a large cerebral cortex relative to all other animals, with this, humans are enabled with certain attributes
                and abilities with these larger cerebral cortex. One of those abilities gained is faster processing speed. The large cerebral cortex 
                provides humans with vast amount of "thinking space", and so with this greater amount to think we are able to take in large amount of 
                data and information and process all that information at great speeds, again relative to other animals. A second ability enabled with 
                a large cerebral cortex is that ability to problem solve and have abstract thought. Again this is because with a greater amount of space
                to store information, humans are able to hold more information to come back on and then problem solve and understand a problem based on
                all this stored information. A third part that comes with a large cerebral cortex has already been mentioned several times, the vast 
                amount of space to store information from memories, to sensory data, the human's cerebral cortex is able to be molded to store a lot of info.
