        <p>
            Biology skills is all about applying knowledge gained from studying to researching and 
            gaining more information from organisms and the environment. Mastery of this outcome is shown
            from observation, research, data collection, to creative thinking and visualization of data.

        <h2>Mastery #1:</h2>
        <p>
             The first media piece that shows mastery of biology skills is research notes I did while
             taking field notes. The field notes show mastery because they show application of note taking
             in the outdoors. The media piece shows observation, visualization and interpretation of both the 
             environment and notes.
