          The biology concepts outcome serves to describe and explain natural biological phenomena. Mastery of this outcome can be 
          shown with varying ideas and concepts described, drawn, or shown in another form.

        <h2>Mastery #1:</h2>
        <p>
            For demonstration of mastery of biology concepts, I have included a timeline of the earth. This timeline is very basic in the 
            amount of information that it provides, but focuses on the key points for bio, such as first recording of bacteria, eukaryotes, and other 
            advances in the biological timeline. This shows mastery of the biology concept because it is a representation that shows an understanding of key
            points in history and ideas that go with those key points.

        <h2 style="padding-top: 50px;">Mastery #2:</h2>
        <p>
            In the second media piece, I've used a quiz answer to show mastery of biology concepts. The quiz question asks about 2 misconceptions for sense, and shows mastery because it demonstrates  
            an understanding of senses, and common misconceptions that often float around.
        </p>

        <div class="column">
            <h4>Quiz Question:</h4>
            <p id="text_paragraph">
                People often have misconceptions about senses.  Select two characteristics of human senses that people may be confused about and explain them correctly.
            </p>
            <h4>My answer:</h4>
            <p style="font-size: large;"; id="text_paragraph">
                When looking at characteristics of human senses, one of the largest misconceptions is the idea that all of the body parts are able to heal relatively quickly. This however is not the case for ears. For most of the parts of the human body, they are able to heal with healthy cells dividing to replace the dead cells. But the cells in the ear, or many of the cells making up the ear don't often divide to recover those dead or injured cells. This means that your ear can become permanently damaged from one moment where someone has not been careful enough to protect their ears.
                <br>
                Another, more fascinating misconception, is one that has to do with the sense of smell. Many see this as the least important sense, or the weakest sense. But the nose and it's sense is vastly adaptable if you are able to train the nose. A sense of smell can actually detect thousands of unique scents, but only if the brain has been trained to identity these scents.
