        <p>
           Animal connections is about human to animal interactions. Mastery of this can be shown with creation of media about an animal, 
           from drawing to videos. Mastery can also be shown through research of animals.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Mastery #1:</h2>
        <p>
            Below is a sketch of a lady bug and demonstrates mastery of animal connection because through this piece of media, a connection and greater understanding is built.
            When researching the lady bug to draw it, I learned in the process where the eyes were located, as well as the structure of the lady bug's legs

            My drawing is of a little lady bug, this drawing can fit the science skills since I discovered where the eyes of the lady bug are. 
            I always wondered since they are very hidden and small. But the eyes of a lady bug are on the front part of the head in between and 
            just behind the antenna of the lady bug.  My drawing does include them, though they are a bit difficult to make out, but that's how 
            they eyes of lady bugs are at first glance.

         <h2 style="padding-top: 50px;">Mastery #2:</h2>
        <p>
            In the second media piece, I've used a quiz answer from a question about classification of animals to show mastery of animal connections. 
            This media piece shows mastery of the animal connections outcome because it goes into a very key aspect of communicating in any field of study, or communication in general. 
            The media piece describes the importance of classification and it's use in communicating.
        <div class="column">
            <h4>Quiz Question:</h4>
            <p id="text_paragraph">
                Patterns are used to organize and classify organisms.  Explain why classification of organisms is important, and describe an example where incorrect identification of an organism could be a problem.
            </p>
            <h4>My answer:</h4>
            <p style="font-size: large;"; id="text_paragraph">
                The classification of organisms is so important because there are just so many organism, and with that there are many sub groups within the general group. 
                There are hundreds upon thousands of classifications and sub-classifications made for each individual living being on this Earth. And this is important 
                because it allows for there to be identification of the unique and individual species or organism. Classification, when incorrect, can be dangerous, 
                an example of the dangers is when looking at the plant called 'Wild Carrot' it looks harmless, but there is another plant called 'poison hemlock' which is not so 
                harmless. This incorrect identification can lead to someone being poisoned because of this.  Another could be that it could ruin a data set if one species is 
                grouped together with another. This would lead bad data points, and if the scientists never realized the mistake could mislead people who read and take for a 
                fact the publishing of whatever published study.
